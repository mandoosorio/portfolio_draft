Since the buttons displayed are set by default, the three different buttons you'll see are 'ok', 'cancel', and 'close'. 'ok' will be equal to 'yes', 'cancel' will be equal to 'no', and 'close' will simply move you on to the next prompt. So let's begin.")

Of course, he wasn't washing his clothes so he would pick up a pair and smell them to check if they were clean. He found a ${color} pair in his freezer, but this one had a shit stain so it was clearly dirty. The second pair he found under his bed. He smelled it and remembered that it was the pair he wore the day he made a caserole that tasted like ${smelly}. That caserole made him so gassy that when he farted, he shot ${height} up into the sky. The end.`);
