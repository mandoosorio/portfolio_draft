# day_calendar
In this application, we will use moment.js to retrieve time and use this data to create if statements that will evaluate whether the current time matches with the time values assigned to each hour block. 

Based on whether the current time is greater than or less than the assigned value of each time block, we will designate background colors to the time block to indicate whether time has passed.

Using local storage, users will be able to save their reminders/to-dos by clicking on the save button.
